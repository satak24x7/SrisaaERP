# Changelog

All notable changes to the GovProjects Platform. Based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (2026-04-20 — R4.5 Bid Management + Platform Features)
- **Tender object** — Indian government tender standards: 35+ fields covering identity (NIT/RFP number, authority, department), classification (Open/Limited/EOI/Single Source, Works/Goods/Services/Consultancy, ICB/NCB), portal (GeM/CPPP/State), financial (estimated value, EMD + mode, tender fee, document cost), key dates (publish, pre-bid, submission online/physical, tech/fin opening), terms (bid validity, completion period), eligibility (turnover, experience, similar work, certifications). Status workflow: PUBLISHED → CORRIGENDUM → PREBID_DONE → SUBMISSION_CLOSED → TECH_OPENED → FIN_OPENED → AWARDED/CANCELLED.
- **Tender list page** — `Bid Management → Tenders` in sidebar. Filters: search, status, type, BU. Summary cards (total, open, closed, estimated value). Sortable table with deadline highlighting (red overdue, amber upcoming with days-left). Click navigates to tender detail.
- **Tender detail page** — 3-column layout (Identity/Portal, Financial/Eligibility, Dates/Terms). Linked Opportunity card. Notes & corrigendum sections.
- **Tender documents** — Upload/download/delete with document types: RFP, Corrigendum, Addendum, BOQ, Drawing, Pre-Bid Minutes, Clarification, Other. Documents grouped by type with file-type icons. 25MB limit.
- **AI RFP Analysis** — Gemini AI integration. Upload RFP document → click "Analyze RFP" → extracts: executive summary, GO/NO-GO recommendation, scope, deliverables, evaluation method/criteria, eligibility requirements, key personnel, risks/red flags, special conditions. Results persisted in `ai_analysis` JSON field. Collapsible UI (collapsed shows recommendation badge only). Smart re-analyze: button disabled when analysis is up-to-date, re-enables when documents change.
- **Gemini configuration** — API key and model name stored in `app_config` table, editable via System → Configuration → AI Integration section. No server restart needed.
- **Opportunity closedStatus** — New field: WON/LOST/CANCELLED/ON_HOLD. Pipeline dashboard filters to show only open opportunities.
- **Orders Booked chart** — Stacked bar chart on Pipeline page: won orders by BU over last 12 months. Orders Won summary cards.
- **Weighted Pipeline by BU** — New pie chart on Pipeline page.
- **Pipeline stage ordering** — Bar chart now sorts stages by lookup list `sort_order` instead of count.
- **In-app notifications** — `notification` table + API (list, unread count, mark read, mark all read). Bell icon in web app header with unread badge + dropdown panel. Mobile: 4th tab "Alerts" with notification list, pull-to-refresh, swipe-to-read. Auto-polls every 30 seconds.
- **Notification triggers** — Travel plan approved/rejected → notify lead traveller. Activity assigned → notify assignee. Event/task reminder 1 hour before start/due time (cron worker, 5-min interval).
- **Mobile app usage tracking** — `app_device` + `app_usage_daily` tables. Device registration on first launch. Session tracking with 2-minute heartbeat sync. Usage persisted in localStorage for crash resilience. Admin page: System → Mobile Usage with summary cards (installed, active now, active today, avg usage), sortable user table, detail dialog with daily usage history.
- **Keycloak user auto-sync** — Creating a user in the app auto-creates a Keycloak account (email as username, default password `Test@1234`). Updating name/email syncs to Keycloak. Changing roles syncs realm roles. Deleting a user disables the Keycloak account. `keycloak-admin.ts` helper library.
- **Mobile app improvements** — Direct login (username/password, no OIDC redirect). Fixed back navigation (returnUrl query param, hardware back button). Date pickers changed from modal to popover (no nav stack pollution). All list defaults to "All" instead of "My Items".

### Added (2026-04-19 — Mobile App: Ionic + Capacitor)
- **Mobile app scaffold** — `apps/mobile/` with Angular 19 + Ionic 8 + Capacitor 6. Tab-based navigation (Activities, Calendar, Travel Plans). Keycloak OIDC authentication via `angular-auth-oidc-client`.
- **Activities tab** — list view with Open/Upcoming/Completed segment tabs, My Items toggle, create/edit/detail pages with form validation, swipe actions (complete task, edit), floating action button for new activity.
- **Calendar tab** — custom month grid with colored dots (green=events, blue=tasks, purple=travel plans), day selection shows day's events in a list, multi-day event rendering, navigation between months.
- **Travel Plans tab** — list with status filter chips (All/Draft/Submitted/Approved/Completed), detail page with 4 segments (Tickets/Hotels/Expenses/Summary), workflow transition buttons (Submit/Approve/Reject/Complete) based on current status and user role.
- **Android platform** — Capacitor Android project configured, debug APK builds successfully via `npx cap sync android && cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`.

### Changed (2026-04-19 — R3 Architecture Refinements)
- **Task renamed to Work Item** — UI labels in project execution context changed from "Task" to "Work Item". API paths (`/tasks`) unchanged for backward compatibility.
- **PBG & Retention renamed to Bank Guarantees** — clearer label across UI. API paths (`/pbg-records`) unchanged.
- **MilestoneDeliverable model** — milestones now have child deliverables; auto-complete milestone when all deliverables marked COMPLETED.
- **Milestone.originalPlannedDate** — set once on project DRAFT to ACTIVE transition; enables baseline variance tracking.
- **Cash Flow moved to standalone page** — removed from project detail tabs; now at `/execution/cash-flow` with a project selector dropdown.
- **Sidebar accordion** — only one group open at a time (accordion behavior).
- **Activity `mine=true` filter fixed** — `resolveMyUserId` was returning undefined; now correctly resolves from auth context.
- **Activity category** — resolves display label from lookup list instead of raw value.
- **Activities linkable to Projects** — `PROJECT` added to polymorphic association entity types.
- **Project Dashboard** — summary cards with contract value totals, filterable project table.
- **Project Documents** — upload with card view, drag-reorder via CDK, authenticated blob download.
- **9-tab project detail page** — Health, Overview, Activities, Work Items, Milestones, Budget, Bank Guarantees, Risks & Issues, Documents.

- **Lead CRUD + Convert** — BU-required. Source, status (NEW→QUALIFIED→CONVERTED/LOST). `POST /leads/:id/convert` creates Opportunity in transaction. Angular: table + form with BU/Account dropdowns, Convert button on active leads.
- **Opportunity CRUD + Detail Page** — dedicated `/sales/opportunities/:id` page with two-column layout. Stage + Entry Path from lookup lists (removed hardcoded enums). Multiple contacts (`opportunity_contact` join), multiple influencers (`opportunity_influencer` join). Owner user. Account + End Client. Probability 0-100. clientName auto-populated from End Client.

- **Opportunity Contact linking** — `contactIds[]` on create/update, synced via delete-all + recreate
- Sidebar: Sales group (Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Influencers, Opportunities), Admin (Lookup Lists, Governments added)

### Fixed (2026-04-18)
- All `p-select` and `p-multiSelect` inside `p-dialog` across the entire app now use `appendTo="body"` — fixes dropdown clipping in dialogs where lower options were impossible to select

### Changed (2026-04-18)
- Removed Prisma enums: `OpportunityStage`, `EntryPath`, `AccountType` → replaced with lookup list strings
- `clientName` on Opportunity made optional, auto-populated from End Client account name
- `contactId` removed from Opportunity → replaced with `OpportunityContact` many-to-many join table
- `ownerUserId` added to Opportunity
- `governmentId` added to Account
- `code` field (1-5 chars, unique, no whitespace) added to Government and Account
- Audit middleware: `actorUserId` truncated to 26 chars to fix Keycloak UUID overflow

### Updated docs (2026-04-18)
- `docs/modules/02-sales.md` — entity table with shipped/not-started status
- `docs/solution-specification.md` — added Lookup Lists and CRM Entity Model cross-cutting sections
- `docs/prd.md` — R2 release row updated with shipped CRM + remaining items
- `docs/modules/_status.md` — R2 components added, next-up queue refreshed
- `docs/lessons.md` — 6 new lessons (lookup lists, db push enum changes, audit truncation, detail pages, many-to-many sync, Account/Contact not BU-scoped)

### Added
- API skeleton (`apps/api`) with Express 4 + TypeScript strict, Zod env validation, Pino structured logging, helmet/CORS/compression/rate-limit
- Middleware: `correlation-id`, `auth` (Keycloak JWT — stub verification, TODO before R1 ships), `validate` (Zod wrapper), `audit` (per-request context + `recordAudit()` helper writing to `audit_log`), `error-handler` (standard envelope), `not-found`
- `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/ready` endpoints (public)
- Prisma client singleton + ULID id generator at `apps/api/src/lib/prisma.ts`
- `libs/shared-types` package with `UlidSchema`, `PaginationParams`, `PaginationMeta`, `ErrorEnvelope`, `ErrorDetail`
- Jest + Supertest smoke test for `/health` and `/ready` (mocks Prisma to avoid generated-client dependency)
- Ambient `apps/api/src/types/express.d.ts` extending `Express.Request` with `correlationId`, `user`, `audit`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at repo root (pnpm doesn't read `package.json#workspaces`)
- `docs/lessons.md` capturing R1-bootstrap lessons (env quirks, type-checking pitfalls, doc drift)

### Changed
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: set `engineType = "binary"` so `prisma generate` works on 32-bit Node installs (the local dev machine ships win-x86 Node 20)
- `apps/api/jest.config.ts` → `jest.config.js` to avoid pulling `ts-node` solely for config parsing
- `apps/api/src/app.ts`: removed premature `businessUnitRouter` import (deferred to Session 2 / FR-1.15); cast `pinoHttp` options to bridge pino@9.14 vs. pino-http type drift under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`

### Verified
- `pnpm install` (Node 20.11.1 win-x86, pnpm 9.15.9) — clean, husky `prepare` warning ignored (no `.git`)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api typecheck` — passes
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test` — 3/3 pass
- `pnpm prisma generate` (root, with `PRISMA_*_ENGINE_TYPE=binary`) — generates client into `node_modules/.pnpm/@prisma+client@5.22.0/.../client`
- **Live boot via `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api dev`** on `http://localhost:3000`:
  - `GET /api/v1/health` → 200 `{"data":{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","version":"0.0.1"}}`
  - `GET /api/v1/ready` → 200 `{"data":{"ready":true}}` (stub — DB/Redis probe TBD)
  - `GET /api/v1/no-such-route` → 404 `{"error":{"code":"NOT_FOUND",...}}` envelope
  - `X-Correlation-ID` header round-trips (auto-generated ULID when absent, echoed when supplied)
  - Helmet security headers, CORS, compression, and `RateLimit-Policy: 600;w=60` all present

### Added (continued — env loading)
- `apps/api/src/bootstrap-env.ts` — loads dotenv from monorepo root `.env` (fallback `apps/api/.env`); imported first by `server.ts` so vars exist before `env.ts` validates (fixes ESM hoisting issue where `import 'dotenv/config'` ran after the validator)
- `@prisma/client@5.22.0` added as a root dev dependency so `prisma generate` finds it next to the schema

### Added (2026-04-17 — R1 Session 4: Company Financials, Documents, User-Roles, BU Head)
- **Company financial fields** — `pan` (10-char regex), `gstin` (15-char regex), `bankName`, `bankBranch`, `ifsc` (11-char regex), `accountNo` added to Company model + API + UI. Two-column layout: Organization Details (left) + Financial Information (right).
- **Company Documents** — new `company_document` table + full API (CRUD + file upload via multer + download + reorder). Angular card view with file-type icons (Image/PDF/Word/PPT/Excel/Other), CDK drag-to-reorder, blob-based authenticated view. `sort_order` column for persistent ordering; new docs append to end.
- **User-Role multi-assignment** — new `user_role` join table (many-to-many). API accepts `roleIds[]` on create/update, syncs join table. User list returns `roles: [{id, name, displayName}]`. UI: Roles column shows chip tags; Add/Edit form has PrimeNG MultiSelect for roles.
- **BU Head improvements** — label changed to "BU Head", field changed from text input to filterable dropdown showing only users with `bu_head` role. BU list API includes `buHeadName`. New "BU Head" column in list table.
- **Route wiring fix** — `admin.routes.ts` changed Company Profile, Users, Roles from `PlaceholderComponent` to lazy-loaded real components.
- **Prisma migrations** — `add_company_financials`, `add_company_document`, `add_doc_sort_order`, `add_user_role`

### Updated (2026-04-17 — docs refresh)
- `docs/modules/01-organization-details.md` — entity table with shipped/schema-only status, FR table with status column, shipped API endpoints list, shipped Angular pages list
- `docs/prd.md` — R1 release row updated with shipped components and remaining items
- `docs/solution-specification.md` — added User-Role Model and Company Documents cross-cutting sections
- `docs/modules/_status.md` — refreshed all R1 component statuses and next-up queue
- `docs/lessons.md` — 6 new lessons (route wiring, blob downloads, Prisma regen, CDK drag grid, user-role sync, BU head filter)

### Added (2026-04-17 — R1 Session 3 cont'd: Company, Role & User Integration Tests)
- `apps/api/test/company.integration.test.ts` — **8 tests**: GET 404 when no profile, GET returns existing, 401 without auth, PATCH upsert creates (201), PATCH updates existing (200), audit on create, audit on update with before/after, 400 on invalid input
- `apps/api/test/role.integration.test.ts` — **18 tests**: POST create + DB verify + audit, 409 duplicate name, 400 missing name, 401 without auth, GET list (empty, seeded, cursor pagination, ?q= search), GET single + 404, PATCH update + audit + 409 rename conflict + 404, DELETE soft-delete + audit, 422 system role guard, 422 refs-guard with BU member, 404 non-existent
- `apps/api/test/user.integration.test.ts` — **21 tests**: POST create + DB verify + audit, 409 duplicate email, 400 missing fields, 400 invalid email, 401 without auth, GET list (empty, seeded, cursor pagination, status filter, ?q= search), GET single + BU membership include + 404 + 404 soft-deleted, PATCH update + audit + 409 email conflict + status change + 404, DELETE soft-delete + audit + 404
- `apps/api/test/helpers.ts` — added `seedRole()`, `seedCompany()`, `seedBuMember()` seed helpers
- `apps/api/package.json` — `test:integration` now uses `--runInBand` (serial execution required — all suites share one DB, parallel `truncateAll()` causes FK violations)

### Verified
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api typecheck` — passes
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test` — **19/19 unit tests pass**
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test:integration` — **71/71 integration tests pass** (5 suites: health 4, BU 20, company 8, role 18, user 21)

### Added (2026-04-17 — R1 Session 3 cont'd: Integration Test Harness)
- `apps/api/jest.integration.config.js` — separate Jest config for integration tests (`*.integration.test.ts`), with 30s timeout, `globalSetup` that pushes Prisma schema to `govprojects_test` DB, and `globalTeardown`
- `apps/api/test/setup.integration.ts` — integration test bootstrap pointing `DATABASE_URL` at `govprojects_test` (port 3307); mocks `jose` (auth already verified end-to-end)
- `apps/api/test/helpers.ts` — shared test utilities: `getTestPrisma()` (dedicated client for test assertions), `truncateAll()` (FK-safe table reset per test), `fakeJwt()`, seed helpers for User, BusinessUnit, and Project
- `apps/api/test/health.integration.test.ts` — **4 tests**: health 200, no-auth access, correlation-id echo, /ready with real DB+Redis
- `apps/api/test/business-unit.integration.test.ts` — **20 tests**: full CRUD against real MySQL — create + DB persistence + audit log assertion, 422 on missing BU head, 400 on missing name, 401 without auth, empty list, seeded list, cursor pagination across 3 pages, status filter, text search via `?q=`, single get, 404 not found, 404 soft-deleted, patch + DB verify + audit before/after, BU head re-validation on patch, delete + soft-delete verify + audit, 422 refs-guard with seeded project, 404 on unknown, 404 on already-deleted
- `apps/api/jest.config.js` — added `testPathIgnorePatterns` to exclude `*.integration.test.ts` from unit test runs
- `apps/api/package.json` — added `test:integration` script
- `docker exec` creates `govprojects_test` database; `prisma db push` syncs schema

### Verified
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test` — **19/19 unit tests pass** (integration tests excluded)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test:integration` — **24/24 integration tests pass** (real MySQL + Redis)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api typecheck` — passes

### Added (2026-04-17 — R1 Session 3: Keycloak Auth Wire-up)
- `scripts/keycloak-bootstrap.ts` — idempotent provisioning script that creates the `govprojects` realm, `govprojects-api` (confidential) and `govprojects-web` (public SPA) clients, audience mapper (so `aud` claim includes `govprojects-api`), 8 realm roles (`super_admin`, `admin`, `bu_head`, `project_manager`, `site_engineer`, `procurement_officer`, `finance_officer`, `viewer`), and a dev test user (`testuser` / `Test@1234`, role: `admin`). Run via `pnpm tsx scripts/keycloak-bootstrap.ts`.
- `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts` — **replaced stub JWT decoder** with real `jose` JWKS verification: `createRemoteJWKSet` fetches keys from `${JWT_ISSUER}/protocol/openid-connect/certs`, `jwtVerify` validates signature, issuer (`JWT_ISSUER`), audience (`JWT_AUDIENCE`), and expiry. Invalid/expired/unsigned tokens are silently rejected (no `req.user` → 401 from `requireAuth`). The `AuthenticatedUser` interface, `requireAuth`, and `requireRole` helpers are unchanged.
- `apps/api/test/setup.ts` — global `jose` mock for unit tests: `jwtVerify` decodes the base64url payload from fake JWTs without signature checks, keeping all 19 existing tests passing without a live Keycloak.

### Fixed (2026-04-17)
- `apps/api/src/modules/admin/user/repository.ts` + `service.ts` — changed `status` field types from `string` to `UserStatus` (Prisma enum) to fix 3 pre-existing TS2322 type errors.

### Verified (live, real Keycloak + MySQL + Redis)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api typecheck` — passes (was failing before due to UserStatus type mismatch)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test` — **19/19 pass**
- Keycloak bootstrap script ran successfully against `http://localhost:8080` — realm, clients, roles, audience mapper, test user all provisioned
- Real JWT from Keycloak (`grant_type=password`, `client_id=govprojects-web`, user `testuser`) → `GET /api/v1/business-units` returns **200** with data
- No token → **401**; garbage token → **401**; fake unsigned JWT → **401** (JWKS verification rejects)
- `GET /api/v1/health` remains public (no auth required)

### Unblocked (2026-04-17 — R1 Session 1 cont'd)
- Docker Desktop installed on host; `docker compose up -d` brings up **MySQL 8 (healthy)**, **Redis 7 (healthy)**, **RabbitMQ**, **Keycloak 24**, **MinIO (healthy)**, **OpenSearch 2.13**, **MailHog**
- Host already runs native **MySQL84** service on port 3306 → added **`docker-compose.override.yml`** (gitignored) that uses `!override` to remap the compose MySQL to host port **3307**; updated `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to `mysql://govprojects:govprojects@localhost:3307/govprojects`. The override pattern keeps the checked-in `docker-compose.yml` canonical.
- Granted `govprojects` MySQL user `ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.*` (needed for Prisma shadow-database during `migrate dev`)
- **Initial Prisma migration applied**: `apps/api && pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name init --schema=../../prisma/schema.prisma` → created `prisma/migrations/20260416191453_init/migration.sql` and 25 tables (`business_unit`, `company`, `user`, `employee`, `opportunity`, `project`, `task`, `material_request` + lines, `expense_sheet` + lines + events, `vendor`, `item`, `bank_account`, `certification`, `dsc`, `empanelment`, `past_project`, `statutory_registration`, `turnover_record`, `attachment`, `audit_log`, `outbox_event`, `_prisma_migrations`)
- Prisma client regenerated (`engine=binary`, v5.22.0)

### Added (2026-04-17 — /ready now real)
- `apps/api/src/lib/redis.ts` — singleton ioredis client bound to `env.REDIS_URL`, lazy connect, `maxRetriesPerRequest: 2`
- `/api/v1/ready` now runs `SELECT 1` (via `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe`) **and** `redis.ping()` in parallel; returns **200** when both pass, **503** when either fails, with a `checks: { db, redis }` object carrying per-probe `ok`/`error` detail
- `apps/api/test/health.test.ts` expanded to 5 tests (was 3): happy-path, DB-fails-503, Redis-fails-503 cases added with Jest mocks of `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe` and `redis.ping`

### Verified (live)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api typecheck` — passes
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test` — 5/5 pass
- Live `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api dev`:
  - `GET /api/v1/ready` with MySQL + Redis up → 200 `{"data":{"ready":true,"checks":{"db":{"ok":true},"redis":{"ok":true}}}}`
  - `docker stop govprojects-redis` → 503 `{"data":{"ready":false,"checks":{"db":{"ok":true},"redis":{"ok":false,"error":"Reached the max retries per request limit..."}}}}`
  - `docker start govprojects-redis` → back to 200 on next poll (recovery works)

### Added (2026-04-17 — R1 Session 2: Business Unit CRUD, FR-1.15)
- `libs/shared-types/src/organization/business-unit.ts` — `BusinessUnitStatus`, `ApprovalThresholdRule`, `ApprovalThresholds`, `BusinessUnitDto`, `CreateBusinessUnitInput`, `UpdateBusinessUnitInput`, `ListBusinessUnitsQuery`. Barrel `libs/shared-types/src/organization/index.ts` re-exported from the root entry.
- `libs/shared-types` is now a workspace dependency of `apps/api` (`workspace:*`).
- `apps/api/src/modules/organization/business-unit/{types,repository,service,routes}.ts` — full CRUD with:
  - **Endpoints:** `GET /api/v1/business-units` (cursor-paginated list, `?status`/`?q`/`?cursor`/`?limit` filters, `next_cursor` computed by fetching `limit+1`), `POST /business-units`, `GET /business-units/:id`, `PATCH /business-units/:id`, `DELETE /business-units/:id` (soft delete via `deleted_at`)
  - **BU Head validation** — asserts `buHeadUserId` references an active User, 422 `BU_HEAD_NOT_FOUND` otherwise
  - **Refs guard on delete** — counts active `project`, `opportunity`, `expense_sheet`, `material_request` rows pointing at the BU; returns 422 `BU_HAS_REFERENCES` with per-type counts in `error.details` so the UI can tell the user exactly what to reassign
  - **Audit on every write** — `recordAudit` emits CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE with before/after snapshots, keyed by `resource_type='business_unit'`
  - Uses `Prisma.BusinessUnitUncheckedUpdateInput` so FK field `buHeadUserId` can be set directly on update (Prisma's checked type requires `{ buHead: { connect: { id } } }`)
  - ULID cursor pagination — ULIDs are lex-sortable so `orderBy: { id: 'asc' }` + `cursor: { id }` + `skip: 1` gives stable forward paging without a secondary timestamp column
- `apps/api/src/app.ts` — registers `businessUnitRouter` under `/api/v1/business-units`
- `apps/api/test/business-unit.test.ts` — **14 supertest cases** covering list pagination (with/without next_cursor), auth required (401), single get + 404 + 400-on-invalid-ULID, create happy path + audit write assertion + 422 head-not-found + 400 missing-name, patch update with before/after audit + 422 on swapping in a missing head, delete happy-path 204 + 422 BU_HAS_REFERENCES with per-type count assertion + 404 unknown id
- `docs/api/endpoints.md` — FR-1.15 endpoints moved from "planned" to "shipped" with the full semantics described inline

### Verified (live, real MySQL + Redis)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/shared-types build` — emits `dist/` for workspace consumers
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api typecheck` — passes
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api test` — **19/19 pass** (5 health + 14 BU)
- `pnpm --filter @govprojects/api dev` + curl against `http://localhost:3000`:
  - 401 without `Authorization` header
  - 201 on valid create; response has canonical DTO; id is a ULID generated in app code
  - 422 `BU_HEAD_NOT_FOUND` when `buHeadUserId` points at a non-existent user
  - 400 `VALIDATION_FAILED` on missing `name` with `details:[{path:"name",message:"Required"}]`
  - 200 list returns `{data:[...], meta:{next_cursor:null, limit:50}}`
  - 200 single get
  - 200 patch with bumped `updatedAt`
  - 404 `NOT_FOUND` on unknown id
  - **422 `BU_HAS_REFERENCES`** after inserting a real `project` row referencing the BU; `error.details` = `{projects:1, opportunities:0, expenseSheets:0, materialRequests:0}`
  - 204 delete succeeds after removing the project row
  - `audit_log` table has CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE rows with `resource_type='business_unit'`, `actor_user_id='usr_stub'` (the auth stub — real Keycloak sub lands next session)

### Infra notes (2026-04-17)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` (gitignored) remaps compose MySQL to host port **3307** using YAML `!override` tag because the host runs a native `MySQL84` service on 3306. The `!reset` tag clears the list entirely; `!override` replaces it.
- `govprojects` MySQL user was granted `ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* WITH GRANT OPTION` so Prisma's shadow-database creation works during `migrate dev`. Re-run this grant if the MySQL volume is ever wiped.
- Prisma CLI does not pick up the monorepo-root `.env` — export `DATABASE_URL` (and `PRISMA_*_ENGINE_TYPE=binary` for the 32-bit Node quirk) before calling `prisma migrate`/`generate`.
- Initial repository scaffold with monorepo layout (apps/web, apps/mobile, apps/api, libs/*)
- Documentation set: solution spec, PRD, 5 module FR docs, architecture, security, database, API conventions
- Prisma schema starter covering Module 1 (Organization Details) + cross-cutting tables (audit_log, outbox_event, attachment)
- Docker Compose for local dev: MySQL 8, Redis 7, RabbitMQ, Keycloak, MinIO, OpenSearch, MailHog
- `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- `CLAUDE.md` with stack, conventions and workflow expectations for AI-assisted development

### Pending (R1 — Foundation)
- Monorepo bootstrap with pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- Express API skeleton with middleware (correlation-id, auth, zod-validate, audit, error-handler)
- Angular 17 app shell with Keycloak OIDC auth
- Ionic app shell sharing auth with web
- Business Unit CRUD (FR-1.15)
- Company profile + compliance masters (FR-1.1 to FR-1.9)
- Expiry dashboard (FR-1.13)
- RBAC + BU-scope enforcement
